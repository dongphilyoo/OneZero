# OneZero

One Zero is an interactive installation that I and Dongphil Yoo presented at 2018 ITP spring show. It consist of two computers on a rail and bulb in the middle. We wanted to explore the recognition of machine and human. Based on the distances between laptops from the bulb in the middle, we calculate the the movement of a red ball traveling between two monitors, and when the ball pass though the middle the red bulb turn on. Audience recognize as if actually the ball travels in the air between the laptops.
